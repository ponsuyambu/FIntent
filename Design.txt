Design Decisions
============================
1. If a fragment is not added to the backstack, it will not be removed from the fragment manager
even when clear back stack is called. i.e POP_BACK_STACK_INCLUSIVE. It is creating weird problems in fragment life cycle
also. Due to this reasons, in this design, FRAGMENT IS ALWAYS ADDED TO BACK STACK. BASED ON THE USE CASE, CORRESPONDING
FRAGMENTS WILL BE POPPED OFF. This decision solves most of the complex issues with fragment back stack navigation.

2. An FIntentController only handles the navigation inside a single container.
