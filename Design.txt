Design Decisions
============================
1. If a fragment is not added to the back stack, it will not be removed from the fragment manager
even when clear back stack is called. i.e POP_BACK_STACK_INCLUSIVE. It is creating weird problems in fragment life cycle
also. Due to this reason, in this design, FRAGMENT IS ALWAYS ADDED TO BACK STACK. BASED ON THE USE CASE, CORRESPONDING
FRAGMENTS WILL BE POPPED FROM BACK STACK. This decision solves most of the complex issues with fragment back stack navigation.

2. An FIntentController only handles the navigation inside a single container.

3. setRetainInstanceState(true) is used by all fragments
